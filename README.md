# Skin Cancer Prediction Using U-NET

Im Using U
Net Model for this exam because U-Net are :

**End-to-end architecture**: UNet is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that can be trained on large datasets, providing a fast and efficient way to perform image segmentation.

**U-shaped structure**: The U-shaped structure of the UNet architecture allows for high-level feature extraction from the contracting path and precise localization in the expansive path.

**Skip connections**: UNet uses skip connections that concatenate feature maps from the contracting path to the expansive path, allowing the network to leverage lower-level features for detailed segmentation.

**Transfer learning**: Pre-trained UNet models on large datasets can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for various medical imaging tasks, reducing the amount of annotated data required.

**Good performance on medical images**: UNet has shown good performance on medical image segmentation tasks, making it a popular choice in the field of medical image analysis.
